# Scheduler — Height-ordered dirty scope queue with render prioritization.
#
# When signals change, the scopes that subscribe to them are marked dirty.
# The Scheduler collects these dirty scopes and processes them in
# height-first order (lowest height = shallowest = closest to root).
#
# This ensures parent components re-render before their children,
# which avoids redundant child re-renders when a parent's output
# changes the child tree entirely.
#
# Design:
#   - `collect()` drains the runtime's dirty queue into the scheduler.
#   - `next()` returns the next scope to render (lowest height first).
#   - `is_empty()` checks if there are pending scopes.
#   - Duplicate scope IDs are deduplicated automatically.
#
# The scheduler does NOT own the Runtime — it borrows a pointer to it
# for querying scope heights and draining the dirty queue.
