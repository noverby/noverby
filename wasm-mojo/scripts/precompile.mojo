"""Pre-compile the WASM binary into a serialized .cwasm module.

This script compiles build/out.wasm using the wasmtime engine and
serializes the result to build/out.cwasm.  The .cwasm file can then
be loaded by the test harness via Module.deserialize_file, which is
essentially an mmap and skips the expensive compilation step entirely.

Usage:
    mojo run -I ../wasmtime-mojo/src build/precompile.mojo
