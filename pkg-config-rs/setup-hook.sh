# pkg-config-rs setup hook
#
# This hook ensures that dependencies' .pc files are discoverable
# by adding their lib/pkgconfig and share/pkgconfig directories
# to PKG_CONFIG_PATH when they appear as build inputs.
#
# This is the essential piece that makes pkg-config-rs a drop-in
# replacement for Nixpkgs' pkg-config wrapper in Nix builds.

# Skip setup hook if we're neither a build-time dep, nor doing a native compile.
