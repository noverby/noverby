//! The `RuntimeInfo` encapsulates all information systemd-rs needs to do its job. The units, the pid and filedescriptors and the systemd-rs config.
//!
//! In the lifetime of systemd-rs there will only ever be one `RuntimeInfo` which is passed wrapped inside the `ArcMutRuntimeInfo`.
//!
//! The idea here is to make as much as possible concurrently readable while still being able to get exclusive access to e.g. remove units.
//! Note that units themselves contain `RWLocks` so they can be worked on concurrently as long as no `write()` lock is placed on the `RuntimeInfo`.

/// Shared handle to the PID table, accessible without the RuntimeInfo RwLock.
///
/// The PID table is wrapped in `Arc<Mutex<…>>` so that the signal handler can
/// update entries (e.g. `Service` → `ServiceExited`) **without** acquiring a
/// read lock on `RuntimeInfo`.  This breaks a 3-way deadlock:
///
///   1. Activation threads hold **read locks** on RuntimeInfo while polling
///      `wait_for_service` (which checks the PID table for `ServiceExited`).
///   2. A `systemctl` command (e.g. from a udev rule) tries to acquire a
///      **write lock** — it blocks because readers hold locks, and on glibc's
///      writer-preferring `pthread_rwlock` all *new* readers are also blocked.
///   3. The service-exit handler thread needs a **read lock** to update the
///      PID table — but it is blocked by the pending writer from (2).
///
/// By giving the signal handler a cloned `Arc` it can update the PID table
/// directly, allowing `wait_for_service` to observe `ServiceExited` and
/// release the read lock, which in turn unblocks the writer and the exit
/// handler.
