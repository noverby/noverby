"""High-level wrapper for wasm_engine_t.

The Engine is the top-level compilation environment for WebAssembly modules.
It manages global compilation settings and caches.

Usage:
    var engine = Engine()

    # engine is automatically cleaned up when it goes out of scope

    # With module caching enabled (persists compiled modules to disk):
