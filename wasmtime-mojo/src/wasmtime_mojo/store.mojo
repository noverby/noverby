"""High-level wrapper for wasmtime_store_t and wasmtime_context_t.

A Store is the unit of isolation in Wasmtime — it holds all runtime state
for a set of instances (memories, globals, tables, etc.).  Every Store is
tied to an Engine that controls compilation settings.

The Context is the short-lived handle used for most store operations.
It is derived from the Store and remains valid as long as the Store lives.

Usage:
    var engine = Engine()
    var store = Store(engine)
    var ctx = store.context()
    # ... pass ctx to instantiation, function calls, memory access ...
